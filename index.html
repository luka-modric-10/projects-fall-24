        <p>An informal travel log. Come along!</p>

        <h2>Türkiye &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &star;</h2>
        <p>A beautiful country split down the middle with halves in both Europe and Asia. I spent 10 days here in the summer with two of my sisters + a friend, 
            and it was an unforgettable experience. The food was amazing everywhere. I would've surely gained a few pounds if if wasn't for all the walking I had to do!
            Everywhere was photo-op worthy, and don't get me started on the cats! If I could speak the language, I wouldn't mind living there.</p>

        <h2>United Arab Emirates &starf; &starf; &star; &star; &star;</h2>
        <p>I wish I had better things to say about this country, but I didn't enjoy myself on this trip. It was just my older sister and I, and I felt bad that
            she was clearly enjoying herself more than I was. I felt like a buzzkill, but the only thing I enjoyed was the shopping! Complaining about the heat 
            in a desert is pointless, but worth mentioning? The moral concerns raised after I had left involving the gold trade from Sudan, migrant worker's 
            rights, freedom of expression, and LGBTQ+ rights definitely took this country off my list in perpetuity. I felt icky for having contributed to any of it 
            by just visiting for about a week. Gorgeous architecture, but the city felt soulless. </p>

        <h2>Senegal &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf; &starf;</h2>
        <p>My home country. I wasn't born there, but I feel homesick just writing about her. Words feel inadequate to describe the beauty that radiates from this coastal gem.
            The <strong>dun dun dun dun</strong> of the sabar drums at a wedding, the savory spices in a freshly made plate of thieboudienne, and the thunderous call of the Athaan from the 
            mosque at prayer time. Nothing compares to its sandy beaches and dark blue waters. Tailor-made outfits made from bright waxy fabric, and the noisy chatter
            at the hair salon. What I wouldn't give to be back!</p>
