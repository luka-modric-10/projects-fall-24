                <p>Greenland, <em>the world's largest island</em>, is about 80&#37; ice capped.</p>
                <p>The Inuit came to Greenland from North America in a series of migrations that stretched from 2500 BC to the 11th century. Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland
                became part of the Kingdom of Denmark in <time datetime="1953">1953</time>. It joined the European Community (now the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) with Denmark in <time datetime="1973">1973</time> but withdrew in <time datetime="1985">1985</time> over a dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland remains a member of the EU's Overseas Countries and Territories Association.</p> 
                <p>The Danish parliament granted Greenland home rule in <time datetime="1979">1979</time>; the law went into effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of self-government in <time datetime="2008">2008</time> and acquired greater responsibility for internal affairs when the <a href="https://english.stm.dk/media/10522/gl-selvstyrelov-uk.pdf">Act on Greenland Self-Government</a> was signed into law in <time datetime="2009">2009</time>. The Kingdom of Denmark, however, continues to exercise control over several policy areas on behalf of Greenland, including foreign affairs, security, and financial policy, in consultation with Greenland's Self-Rule Government.</p>
